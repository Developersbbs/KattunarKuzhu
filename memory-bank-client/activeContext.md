# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently focusing on implementing a custom theme with a new color palette (#2D1248 and #E1E4DD), fixing build issues for production deployment, and setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## Recent Changes
1. **Theme Implementation:**
   - Updated the Gradient component to use the new color palette (#2D1248 and #E1E4DD)
   - Modified the component to adapt to light/dark themes using useColorScheme
   - Enhanced the theme configuration with proper color transitions

2. **Build Configuration Improvements:**
   - Added React Native dotenv support in babel.config.js
   - Updated app.json with production-ready configurations
   - Created environment variable type declarations in env.d.ts
   - Added EAS Build configuration in eas.json
   - Fixed JVM compatibility issues in gradle.properties
   - Increased Java heap space to prevent out of memory errors
   - Configured build to use debug signing for release builds

3. **CI/CD Setup:**
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow for Android builds
   - Configured workflow to build debug APK, release APK, and AAB files
   - Set up automatic release creation on push to main branch
   - Added documentation for the CI/CD process

## Key Components in Progress
1. **Theme System:**
   - Custom color palette implementation (#2D1248 and #E1E4DD)
   - Adaptive theming for light/dark modes
   - Gradient background that responds to theme changes

2. **Build System:**
   - Android build configuration
   - Environment variable management
   - Production readiness improvements
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Next Steps
1. **Theme System:**
   - Apply the new theme colors to all components
   - Create theme utility functions for consistent usage
   - Test theme switching on all platforms

2. **Build System:**
   - Test the GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up proper keystore for release signing
   - Test builds on iOS platform

3. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Add iOS build workflow
   - Implement automated testing
   - Set up deployment to app stores

## Technical Decisions
1. **Color Palette:**
   - Primary: #2D1248 (dark purple)
   - Secondary: #E1E4DD (light gray with slight green tint)
   - These colors will be used consistently across the app

2. **Build Approach:**
   - Using Expo EAS Build for production builds
   - Local builds for testing and development
   - Environment variables for configuration management
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Implementation Challenges
1. **Android Build Issues:**
   - JVM compatibility issues between Kotlin and Java
   - Memory limitations during build process
   - Keystore configuration for release signing

2. **Theme Implementation:**
   - Ensuring consistent theme application across platforms
   - Handling platform-specific theme behaviors
   - Managing gradient backgrounds with theme switching

3. **CI/CD Challenges:**
   - Setting up secure key management for signing
   - Optimizing build times in the CI environment
   - Handling environment-specific configurations
