# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in early development stage with the basic framework and navigation structure in place. The focus appears to be on establishing the core UI components and navigation system.

## Recent Changes
Based on git status, there are changes to:
- `app.json` - Likely configuration updates
- `app/index.tsx` - Home screen modifications

## Key Components in Progress
1. **Home Screen** (`app/index.tsx`):
   - Currently has a basic layout with a gradient background
   - Contains a `FeatureCard` component but its implementation is incomplete
   - Ready for content and functionality enhancements

2. **Navigation Structure**:
   - Tab-based navigation is set up with three tabs
   - Basic routing is configured using Expo Router
   - Layout structure is in place for future screen additions

3. **UI Framework**:
   - GlueStack UI components are integrated
   - Theme system is configured for light/dark mode
   - TailwindCSS/NativeWind setup for styling

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### UI Development
- The UI is currently minimal and requires expansion
- Custom components like `FeatureCard` need completion
- Consistent styling using TailwindCSS needs to be applied across screens

### Navigation Enhancements
- Tab names and icons may need refinement
- Additional screens need to be defined and developed
- Navigation flow between screens needs further definition

### State Management
- No global state management solution is currently implemented
- Local component state is used where needed
- Decision on state management approach (Context API, Redux, Zustand, etc.) is pending

### Platform-Specific Adjustments
- Web-specific component variants are implemented for some components
- Additional platform-specific optimizations may be needed
- Testing across platforms is required

## Next Steps
1. Complete the home screen implementation
2. Develop content for tab screens
3. Implement complete navigation flow
4. Add authentication system
5. Develop community features
6. Set up state management solution
7. Implement data storage strategy
8. Add testing framework
